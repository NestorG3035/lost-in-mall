## Choose Your Own Adventure  
--- 
Purpose:
The purpose of this project was to show others that we are well comfortable linking files to each other using markdown syntax and Github commands. We used Github to create an adventure project where the user is allowed to choose his own path and end up with different outcomes. There is a limited amount of outcomes so you have to make thoughtful decisions.
